                  <h1>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                  <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
                    The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, 
                    including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization.
                     Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will
                      cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end 
                      (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader
                       scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating 
                       markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

                  <p> For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
                    communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
                    according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
                    with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
